# Redis Server Implementation in Java

This project is a Java implementation of a Redis server, built as part of the [Codecrafters "Build Your Own Redis" challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis). It demonstrates key concepts in building distributed systems, network protocols, and in-memory databases.

## 📌 What This Project Does

This Redis implementation covers the fundamental components of a modern in-memory data store:

- **RESP Protocol:** Complete implementation of the Redis Serialization Protocol for client-server communication.
- **Multi-threaded Server:** Uses Java's virtual threads to handle concurrent client connections efficiently.
- **Data Structures:** Support for strings, lists, sorted sets, and streams with Redis-compatible operations.
- **Persistence:** RDB file loading and parsing for data durability.
- **Replication:** Master-slave replication with automatic synchronization.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging:** Publisher-subscriber pattern for real-time messaging.
- **Transactions:** ACID-compliant transaction support with MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD.
- **Expiration:** Time-based key expiration with automatic cleanup.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Data Operations

- **String Operations:** `GET`, `SET`, `INCR` with optional expiration times
- **Configuration:** `CONFIG GET` for server configuration retrieval
- **Key Management:** `KEYS`, `TYPE` commands for key introspection
- **Server Info:** `INFO`, `PING`, `ECHO` for server status and diagnostics

### Advanced Data Structures

#### Lists

- **Push Operations:** `LPUSH`, `RPUSH` for adding elements
- **Pop Operations:** `LPOP`, `BLPOP` (blocking) for removing elements
- **Range Operations:** `LRANGE` for retrieving ranges of elements
- **Metadata:** `LLEN` for list length information

#### Sorted Sets

- **Insertion:** `ZADD` for adding scored members
- **Ranking:** `ZRANK` for member position queries
- **Range Queries:** `ZRANGE` for retrieving members by rank
- **Metadata:** `ZCARD`, `ZSCORE` for set information
- **Removal:** `ZREM` for removing members

#### Streams

- **Stream Creation:** `XADD` for adding entries with unique IDs
- **Range Queries:** `XRANGE` for retrieving entries by ID range
- **Blocking Reads:** `XREAD` with optional blocking for real-time consumption

### Messaging & Communication

- **Pub/Sub:** `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `PUBLISH` for message broadcasting
- **Transactions:** `MULTI`, `EXEC`, `DISCARD` for atomic command execution
- **Replication:** `PSYNC`, `REPLCONF`, `WAIT` for master-slave synchronization

### System Features

- **RDB Loading:** Automatic loading of Redis Database files on startup
- **Key Expiration:** Automatic cleanup of expired keys with millisecond precision
- **Blocking Operations:** Non-blocking server design with blocking client operations
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting following Redis conventions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Network Layer

The server uses Java's virtual threads to handle client connections concurrently. Each client connection runs in its own virtual thread, allowing for high concurrency with minimal resource overhead.

### Command Processing

Commands are processed using the Command pattern, with each Redis command implemented as a separate class that implements the `Command` interface.

### Storage Engine

The storage layer provides a thread-safe, concurrent map with support for:

- Key-value storage with expiration
- Type-specific operations (lists, sorted sets, streams)
- Atomic operations and transactions

### RESP Protocol

Complete implementation of the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) for:

- Parsing client requests
- Serializing server responses
- Handling different data types (strings, arrays, integers, errors)

## 🔍 How It Works Internally

The Redis server processes client requests through several stages:

1. **Connection Handling:** When a client connects, the server creates a new `Client` instance running in a virtual thread.

2. **Request Parsing:** The `Deserializer` class parses incoming RESP-formatted requests into `RValue` objects representing the command and arguments.

3. **Command Routing:** The `Redis` class routes parsed commands to the appropriate `Command` implementation based on the command name.

4. **Command Execution:** Each command class implements the `Command` interface with an `execute` method that:

   - Validates arguments
   - Performs the requested operation
   - Returns a properly formatted response

5. **Response Serialization:** Results are serialized back to RESP format and sent to the client.

6. **State Management:** The server maintains:
   - **Storage:** Thread-safe key-value store with expiration
   - **Replication:** List of connected replica servers
   - **Pub/Sub:** Channel subscriptions and message routing
   - **Transactions:** Queued commands for atomic execution

## ⚙️ How to Set Up and Run

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later (for virtual thread support)
- Maven 3.6+ for dependency management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Md-Talim/codecrafters-redis-java.git
   cd codecrafters-redis-java
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   mvn compile
   ```

### Running the Server

**Basic Usage:**

```sh
./your_program.sh
```

**With Configuration Options:**

```sh
./your_program.sh --port 6380 --dir /tmp --dbfilename dump.rdb
```

**As a Replica Server:**

```sh
./your_program.sh --port 6380 --replicaof "localhost 6379"
```

**Available Configuration Options:**

| Option         | Description                   | Default | Example                        |
| :------------- | :---------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------- |
| `--port`       | Port number for the server    | 6379    | `--port 6380`                  |
| `--dir`        | Directory for RDB files       | -       | `--dir /tmp`                   |
| `--dbfilename` | RDB filename                  | -       | `--dbfilename dump.rdb`        |
| `--replicaof`  | Master server for replication | -       | `--replicaof "localhost 6379"` |

### Testing with Redis CLI

```sh
redis-cli -p 6379
```

## 💡 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Concurrency & Thread Safety

- **Challenge:** Handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Solution:** Used Java 21's virtual threads for lightweight concurrency and `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe storage.

### RESP Protocol Implementation

- **Challenge:** Parse and serialize Redis protocol messages correctly.
- **Solution:** Implemented a robust `Deserializer` and `RValue` hierarchy with proper serialization methods.

### Blocking Operations

- **Challenge:** Implement blocking commands like `BLPOP` without blocking the server.
- **Solution:** Used `ReentrantLock` with `Condition` variables for efficient waiting and notification.

### Memory Management

- **Challenge:** Automatic expiration of keys without memory leaks.
- **Solution:** Implemented lazy expiration checking during key access with `CacheEntry` wrapper objects.

### Replication Consistency

- **Challenge:** Keep replica servers synchronized with master state.
- **Solution:** Implemented command propagation with offset tracking and acknowledgment waiting. This was one of the most complex parts of the project, and I benefited from studying [Enzo Caceres' implementation](https://github.com/Caceresenzo/codecrafters--build-your-own-redis--java/) to understand the intricacies of the PSYNC protocol and replica management.

### Stream Data Structure

- **Challenge:** Implement Redis streams with unique ID generation and range queries.
- **Solution:** Created custom `Stream` class with proper ID comparison and concurrent read/write operations.

## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput:** Capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections using virtual threads
- **Memory:** Efficient memory usage with lazy expiration and concurrent data structures
- **Latency:** Low-latency responses through optimized command routing and minimal allocations
- **Scalability:** Master-slave replication support for horizontal scaling

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation has been tested against the CodeCrafters test suite, which validates:

- Protocol compliance with official Redis specification
- Correct behavior for all implemented commands
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Replication functionality
- Transaction atomicity
- Pub/Sub message delivery
